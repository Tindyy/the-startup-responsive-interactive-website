# Design challenge: the funda listing page

# mobile first
This project is build using the mobile first approach. On mobile the mediaviewr shows the main image and underneath are the rest of the images to scroll through. On tablet and desktop the main image is on the right side of the mediaviewer with on the left side 4thumbnails to see and at the bottom is a media teaser with links. 

# Interaction
The interaction i've added is a scrollbar allowing users to scroll through images 

# animation
The animation i added is in the share and save buttons, enhancing the user experience on tablet and desktop devices. These animations create a more engaging and responsive feel.
